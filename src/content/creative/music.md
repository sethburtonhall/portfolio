The radio might help when you feel blue<br>

## Introduction

Music was my first creative pursuit. During my childhood and well into adult life, it was my safe haven, a way for me to escape. I can't remember a time when I did not listen to music deeply, with intention. I started playing piano while I was in elementary school. I picked up the guitar when I was in high school, bass and drums along the way. I pursued music for 15 years after college. I wrote a bunch of songs, played in a bunch of bands and toured the U.S. a few times.
