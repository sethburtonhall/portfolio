<blockquote class="" cite="Me - a few years ago">
Creative Producers are the cornerstone of an independent film. They take a concept and make it a reality. They have an understanding of all aspects of filmmaking, from script development to sales and distribution. They are the unsung heros of independent film.

I received a MFA in Creative Producing from The University of North Carolina School of the Arts in 2018. The Creative Producer was an Instagram account that I started to share my and other's experiences and insights as a Creative Producer in the film industry.
