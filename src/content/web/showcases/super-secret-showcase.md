I was the lead frontend engineer of a composable architecture that enabled teams to work together seamlessly, each within their own optimized experience, without delays or heavy reliance on developers. I am unable to share the product or code, but I can share what I learned and the approach we took.

## Tech Stack

NextJS, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Storybook, Contentful, Cloudinary, Uniform, Cypress, Figma, Miro, and Gitlab.
