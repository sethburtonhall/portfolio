## Introduction

More Dad Jokes is an app that celebrates all the hard joking dads out there. It provides users a way to generate a random dad joke and search for a joke based on a keyword. I created this app during the week leading up to Father's Day during a build-in-public monthly challenge.

### Features

- Search for a joke based on a keyword.
- Toggle light/dark mode.
- Integrates with the ICanHazDadJoke API.

### Tech Stack

- **ICanHazDadJoke API**: A free, open-source API that provides a collection of dad jokes.
