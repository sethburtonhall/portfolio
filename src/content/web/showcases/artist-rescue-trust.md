## Introduction

Artist Rescue Trust is a philanthropic organization that provides financial relief to Professional Artists and Creatives affected by COVID-19. I was responsible for building the marketing site within a JAMstack architecture. I spliced the design mocks into a Gatsby theme.

### Features

- The ability for artists to apply for financial relief
- The ability for donors to provide financial relief to artists
- a team page for the artists who work on the project
- a grantees page that shows the artists who have received financial relief

### Tech Stack

- **Dato CMS**: The headless CMS for the modern web.
- **Gatsby**: A React-based open source framework with performance, scalability and security built-in.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with your existing data.
